README fontconfig


POST-INSTALL
============

After upgrading fontconfig, always build font information cache files by the
following command (or just enable post-install scripts):

	fc-cache --force --system-only

Also, always run rejmerge and upgrade /etc/fonts/fonts.conf and
/etc/fonts/fonts.dtd.

/etc/fonts/conf.avail ships with configuration snippets that can be symlinked
from /etc/fonts/conf.d to enable them.  It's recommended to use these snippets
instead of duplicating XML code in your /etc/fonts/local.conf.

For more information on conf.avail/conf.d, please see:
