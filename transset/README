README transset

REQUIREMENTS

	First of all, for transparency to work in X you have to have X-server
	with XComposite extension working.  transset is not a program that
	creates transparency, it's a program that sets properties for
	windowses.  These properties must then be supported by the underlaying
	X-server.

	Use picom as composite manager, for example.

CONFIGURATION

	You can use keyboard or mouse shortcuts to set transparency value to
	the focused windows.


	Keyboard Bindings
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	See dwm's config.def.h for example.


	Mouse Bindings
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	The "scrollwheel method" can be realized via xbindkeys.  Bind pressing
	control + scrolling up to "transset -p --inc 0.1" and pressing control
	+ scrolling down to "transset --min 0.1 -p --dec 0.2".  The
	"--min"-flag makes sure you'll not be able to make windowses
	invisible.

		~/.xbindkeysrc:
		"transset --min 0.1 -p --dec 0.2"
		control + b:4
		"transset -p --inc 0.1"
		control + b:5

End of file.
